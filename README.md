# gitignore
> Build _.gitignore_ files with Alfred.

**gitignore** is an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflow that lets you
create _.gitignore_ files from Alfred's input interface. It uses templates
provided by [GitHub](https://github.com), and combines them into a single
.gitignore file.

## Requirements

Although it should be pretty self-explanatory, these are the requirements for
this workflow:

- **OS X**
- **Alfred 2**
- **Git**

## Installation

After installing the workflow, you need to download the templates. Enter the
following command into Alfred:

```
gitignore-update
```

Executing this will clone the [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
repository, and make the templates in it available for offline use.

## Usage

To use this workflow, simply type in `gitignore`. You will now see a list of all
templates installed on your machine. You can search for specific templates by
typing in their name. Selecting a template will place add it to the command
line.

If you've selected all templates that you want to combine, simply select the
first item in the list called "Build .gitignore file". This will start the
generation of the template, and open it in TextEdit once it has been created.

Copy & paste the contents of the file and paste them into the `.gitignore` file
in your project.

The temporary file is created in `/tmp/`, and will automatically be deleted
after three days.
